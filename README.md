# Social_Networks
The overall task for this project is to design and develop a standalone application in Python for analysing  small social networks and recommending likely new friends.
The project is an extensive application that needs to be developed and tested incrementally. The implementation 
requires the design, implementation, and testing of an object-oriented Python program that follows the specification 
below and uses custom classes (classes you have defined), appropriate data structures, and file processing. The 
specification below provides less overview on how to do the project as you are expected to come up with and design 
the solution yourself.
Your project development is the culmination of all you have learnt about Python and OOP and will showcase all your 
hard work for part one of this module. The system you develop should become a strong addition to your programming 
portfolio. Hence, you should aim to produce a system that is well-designed, robust, and useful. The system should 
operate smoothly without sluggishness or crashes and should not require instructions or a manual to use.
